## Summary

I count with extensive experience designing, developing,
deploying and maintaining backend services in a variety of technologies
including Java, Scala and most recently Haskell.  
I pay special attention to quality, that's why I prefer to adopt
Functional Programming principles and techniques when I define tech-stacks.

In addition to my technical background I have played
leadership roles in several occasions throughout my career where I had,
among other things, to define and implement engineering processes, train
teams on new technologies and couch less experienced developers.

## Top Skills

- Design large and distributed systems
- Functional programming
- Research and evaluate new technologies
- Train and mentor less experienced developers
- Define development processes with focus on quality; such as CI/CD, TDD and code review

## Main Technologies
